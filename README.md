# ChatBot

Here are the 5 steps to create a chatbot in Python:

1.Import and load the data file
2.Preprocess data
3.Create training and testing data
4.Build the model
5.Predict the response

After importing and loading the data set
When working with text data, we need to perform various preprocessing on the data before we make a machine learning or a deep learning model. Based on the requirements we need to apply various operations to preprocess the data.
Tokenizing is the most basic and first thing you can do on text data. Tokenizing is the process of breaking the whole text into small parts like words.
Here we iterate through the patterns and tokenize the sentence

Now we will lemmatize each word and remove duplicate words from the list. Lemmatizing is the process of converting a word into its lemma form

Then we will create the training data in which we will provide the input and the output.

We have our training data ready, now we will build a deep neural network that has 3 layers. We use the Keras sequential API for this. 
we trained the model for nearly 200 epochs
